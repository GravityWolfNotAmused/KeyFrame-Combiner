# KeyFrame-Concatenater
A 2D Animation Concatenater.


This is a Swing Application which is used for putting together multiple PNG image files of the same size. 
I originally made this for a friend to put together 2D Animation Keyframes together, but could be used to accomplish similar tasks.

# The program currently takes the following inputs to run:

Open path - String input, and Browse buttons, but List doesn't update yet when String input is used.

Save path - String input, and Browse button works completely.

# WARNING: All photo's should be the same dimensions. 
Height, Width.

Rows, Columns.

Provided is a runnable jar file for users who don't understand programming.
